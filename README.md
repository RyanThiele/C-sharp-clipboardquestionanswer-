# Clipboard Assistant

A Clipboard Assistant in C#

## Usage
The program works on things that you copy. For example, you can calculate a sum simply by copying the sum you want to calculate. The program gives a result in a notification and the answer can be added to the sum. You can also view the live bitcoin price with my program by copying bitcoin, bitcoin price or bitcoin price, which is also the same for Ethereum. You can also convert a number or date to roman numeral, for example by copying this. 10 to roman, or 28-01-2020 to roman for dates. Another feature is to put your own question in questions.cs in a dictionary so that you have your own answer program. The effect of this is that you copy a question that you have stored there and you get the answer to that question via notification. When you enter for example the number 10 to hex or 10 to binary the program will convert a number to both hex decimal or a binary number.
